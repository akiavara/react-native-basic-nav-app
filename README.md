The goal of this project is to provide a basic React Native app where you can:
* display a menu burger navigation for low resolutions (else the menu is always open)
* switch between views from this menu
* be able to add items inside the menu without associated view

As this project is a basic app, it's up to you to start from it and to make it your own!
